## Abstract

A common activity between peers in identity systems that feature the ability to generate self-asserted and third-party issued claims is the demand and submission of proofs from a Prover (Holder) to a Verifier. This flow implicitly requires the Holder and Verifier have a known mechanism to facilitate the two primary steps in a proving exchange: the way Verifiers define the proof requirements, and how Provers must encode submissions of proof to align with those requirements.

To address these needs, this Presentation Exchange specification codifies the `Presentation Definition` data format Verifiers can use to articulate proof requirements, as well as the `Presentation Submission` data format Provers can use to submit proofs in accordance with them.

This specification does not endeavor to define transport protocols, specific endpoints, or other means for conveying the formatted objects it codifies, but it is encouraged that others specifications and projects that do define such mechanisms utilize these data formats within their flows.

## Status of This Document

Presentation Exchange is a draft specification being developed within the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), and being designed to incorporate the requirements and learnings from related work of the most active industry players into a shared specification that meets the collective needs of the community. This spec will be updated to reflect relevant changes, and participants are encouraged to actively engage on GitHub (see above) and other mediums (e.g. DIF) where this work is being done.

## Terminology

Term | Definition
:--- | :---------
Decentralized Identifier (DID) | Unique ID string and PKI metadata document format for describing the cryptographic keys and other fundamental PKI values linked to a unique, user-controlled, self-sovereign identifier in a target system (i.e. blockchain, distributed ledger).
Prover | The entity that submits proofs to a Verifier to satisfy the requirements described in a Presentation Definition
Verifier | The entity that defines what proofs they require from a Prover (via a Presentation Definition) in order to proceed with an interaction.

## Presentation Definition

Presentation Definitions articulate what proofs Verifier requires. Often, but not always, they help the Verifier decide how or whether to interact with a Prover. Presentation Definitions are composed of inputs, which describe the forms and details of the proofs they require, and and optional set of selection rules, to allow Subjects flexibility in cases where many different types of proofs may satisfy an input requirement.

The following properties are defined for use at the top-level of the resource - all other properties that are not defined below MUST be ignored:

- `submission_requirement` - The resource ****MAY**** contain this property,
  and if present, its value ****MUST**** conform to the Submission Requirement
  Format. If not present, all inputs listed in the `input_descriptor` array are
  required for submission. The format for this property is described in the
  [`Submission Requirement`](#submission-requirement) section below.
- `input_descriptors` - The resource ****MUST**** contain this property, and
  its value ****MUST**** be an array of Input Descriptor objects. If no
  `submission_requirement` is present, all inputs listed in the
  `input_descriptor` array are required for submission. The composition of
  values under this property are described in the [`Input
  Descriptors`](#input-descriptors) section below.

### Submission Requirement

_Presentation Definitions_ ****MAY**** include _Submission Requirements_,
which are objects that define what combinations of inputs must be submitted
to comply with the requirements a Verifier has for proceeding in a flow (e.g.
credential issuance, allowing entry, accepting an application).
_Submission Requirements_ introduce a set of rule types and mapping instructions
a User Agent can ingest to present requirement optionality to the user, and
subsequently submit inputs in a way that maps back to the rules the verifying
party has asserted (via a `Proof Submission` object). The following section
defines the format for _Submission Requirement_ objects and the selection syntax
verifying parties can use to specify which combinations of inputs are acceptable.

::: example Submission Requirement
```json
  "submission_requirement": {
    "name": "Credential issuance requirements",
    "purpose": "Verify banking, employment, and citizenship information.",
    "rule": "all",
    "from": [
      {
        "name": "Banking Information",
        "purpose": "We need to know if you have an established banking history.",
        "rule": "pick",
        "count": 1,
        "from": "A"
      },
      {
        "name": "Employment Information",
        "purpose": "We need to know that you are currently employed.",
        "rule": "all",
        "from": "B"
      }
      {
        "name": "Citizenship Information",
        "rule": "pick",
        "count": 1,
        "from": "C"
      }
    ]
  },
```
:::

#### Submission Requirement Objects

_Submission Requirement Objects_ describe what combinations of inputs will
satisfy Verifier requires for evaluation in a subsequent [Presentation
Submission](#presentation-submission). _Requirement Objects_ are JSON objects
constructed as follows:

1. The object ****MUST**** contain a `rule` property, and its value
   ****MUST**** be a string matching one of the [Submission Requirement
   Rules](#submission-requirement-rules) values listed in the section below.
2. The _Submission Requirement_ object ****MUST**** contain a `from` property,
   and its value ****MUST**** be one of

	(a) A `group` string matching one or more of the _Input Descriptor_
	objects in the `input_descriptors`

	(b) An array of nested _Submission Requirement_ objects.

3. The object ****MAY**** contain a `name` property, and if present, its value
   ****MUST**** be a string which ****MAY**** be
   used by a consuming User Agent to display the general name of the
   requirement set to a user.
4. The object ****MAY**** contain a `purpose` property and, if present, its
   value ****MUST**** be a string that describes the purpose for which the
   specified requirement is being asserted.
5. The object ****MAY**** contain additional properties as required by
   [Submission Requirement Rules](#submission-requirement-rules), such as
   `count` for the `"pick"` rule.

#### Submission Requirement Rules

[_Submission Requirement
Rules_](#submission-requirement-rules){id="requirement-rules"} are used within
_Submission Requirement Objects_ to describe the specific combinatorial rule
that must be applied to submit a particular subset of required inputs. Rules
are selected by populating the `rule` property with the corresponding string.
An implementation ****MUST**** support the following standard types:

##### `all` rule

- The _Submission Requirement_ object's `rule` property ****MUST**** contain
  the string value `"all"`.

If the `from` property contains a `group` string, it directs the consumer of
the _Presentation Definition_ to submit all members of the matching `group`
string. In the following example, the `from` property contains a `group`
string to require all members of group `"A"`:

::: example Submission Requirement, all, group
  ```json
  "submission_requirement": {
    "name": "Picking all members from group A",
    "purpose": "We need them all",
    "rule": "all",
    "from": "A"
  }
  ```
:::

If the `from` property contains an array of nested _Submission Requirement_
objects, it directs the consumer of the _Presentation Definition_ to submit
members such that each nested _Submission Requirement_ object is satisfied. In
the following example, the `from` property contains an array of nested
_Submission Requirement_ objects to require all members from groups `"A"`,
`"B"`, and `"C"`:

::: example Submission Requirement, all, nested
  ```json
  "submission_requirement": {
    "name": "Picking all members from groups A, B, and C",
    "purpose": "We need them all",
    "rule": "all",
    "from": [
      {"rule": "all", "from": "A"},
      {"rule": "all", "from": "B"},
      {"rule": "all", "from": "C"},
    ]
  }
  ```
:::

##### `pick` rule

- The _Submission Requirement_ object's `rule` property ****MUST**** contain
  the string value `"pick"`.
- The _Submission Requirement_ object ****MUST**** contain a `count` property,
  and its value ****MUST**** be an integer greater than zero.

If the `from` property contains a `group` string, it directs the consumer of
the _Presentation Definition_ to submit all members of the matching `group`
string. In the following example, the `from` property contains a `group`
string to require a single member of group `"B"`:

::: example Submission Requirement, pick, group
  ```json
  "submission_requirement": {
    "name": "Picking one member from group B",
    "purpose": "We only need one",
    "rule": "pick",
    "count": 1,
    "from": "B"
  }
  ```
:::

If the `from` property contains an array of nested _Submission Requirement_
objects, it directs the consumer of the _Presentation Definition_ to submit
members such that the number of satisfied _Submission Requirement_ objects is
exactly `count`. In the following example, the `from` property contains an
array of nested _Submission Requirement_ objects to require either all members
from group `"A"` or two members from group `"B"`:

::: example Submission Requirement, pick, nested
  ```json
  "submission_requirement": {
    "name": "Either all from group A or two from group B",
    "purpose": "Either way works",
    "rule": "pick",
    "count": 1,
    "from": [
      {"rule": "all",  "from": "A"},
      {"rule": "pick", "from": "B", "count": 2},
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Property Values and Evaluation
The following property value and evaluation guidelines summarize many of the
processing-related rules above:
- The `rule` property value may be either `"all"` or `"pick"`.
- If the `rule` property value is `"pick"`, then the `count` property must be
  present.
- The `from` property must contain either a string representing a `group` or an
  array of nested _Submission Requirement_ objects. In the case of a string
  representing a group, the group must match to one or more _Input Descriptor_
  objects within the `input_descriptors` array.
- A _Submission Requirement_ is satisfied with respect to a _Presentation
  Submission_, as defined by the following algorithm:
    - If `from` is a string, then the rule refers to a `group` string defined
	within the _Input Descriptors_, and:
      - If `rule` is `"all"`, then this _Submission Requirement_ is satisfied
	if and only if the _Presentation Submission_ entries match all of the
	`group` string's members.
      - If `rule` is `"pick"`, then this _Submission Requirement_ is satisfied
	if and only if the number of _Presentation Submission_ entries matching
	`group` string's members is exactly `count`.
    - If `from` is an array of _Submission Requirement_ objects, then the
	rule refers to nested requirements, and:
      - If `rule is `"all"`, then this _Submission Requirement_ is satisfied if
	and only if all nested _Submission Requirement_ objects are satisfied.
      - If `rule` is `"pick"`, then this _Submission Requirement_ is satisfied
	if and only if the number of satisfied nested _Submission Requirement_
	objects is exactly `count`.

### Input Descriptors

_Input Descriptors_ are objects used to describe the proofing inputs a Verifier requires
of a Subject before they will proceed with an interaction. _Input Descriptor Objects_
contain a schema URI that links to the schema of the required input data, constraints
on data values, and an explanation why a certain item or set of data is being requested:

#### Input Descriptor Objects

_Input Descriptors_ are objects that describe what type of input data/credential, or sub-fields thereof, is required for submission to the Verifier. _Input Descriptor Objects_ are composed as follows:

  - The object ****MUST**** contain an `id` property. The value of the `id` property ****MUST**** be a unique identifying string that does not conflict with the `id` of another _Input Descriptor_ in the same _Presentation Definition_ object.
  - The object ****MAY**** contain a `group` property, and if present, its value ****MUST**** match one of the grouping strings listed the `from` values of a [_Requirement Rule Object_](#requirement-rule-objects).
  - The object ****MUST**** contain a `schema` property, and its value ****MUST**** be an object composed as follows:
      - The object ****MUST**** contain a `uri` property, and its value ****MUST**** be an array consisting of one or more valid URI strings for the acceptable credential schemas. A common use of multiple entries in the `uri` array is when multiple versions of a credential schema exist and you wish to express support for submission of more than one version.
      - The object ****MAY**** contain a `name` property, and if present its value ****SHOULD**** be a human-friendly name that describes what the target schema represents.
      - The object ****MAY**** contain a `purpose` property, and if present its value ****MUST**** be a string that describes the purpose for which the credential's data is being requested.
      - The object ****MAY**** contain a `metadata` property, and if present its value ****MUST**** be an object with metadata properties that describe any information specific to the acquisition, formulation, or details of the credential in question.
  - The object ****MAY**** contain a `constraints` property, and its value ****MUST**** be an object composed as follows: 
      - The object ****MAY**** contain a `limit_disclosure` property, and if present its value ****MUST**** be a boolean value. Setting the property to `true` indicates that the processing entity ****SHOULD NOT**** submit any fields beyond those listed in the `fields` array (if present). Setting the property to `false`, or omitting the property, indicates the processing entity ****MAY**** submit a response that contains more than the data described in the `fields` array.
      - The object ****MAY**** contain a `fields` property, and its value ****MUST**** be an array of [_Input Descriptor Field Entry_](#input-descriptor-field-entry) objects, each being composed as follows:
          - The object ****MUST**** contain a `path` property, and its value ****MUST**** be an array of one or more [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) string expressions, specifically this variant of JSONPath: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath, that select some subset of values from the target input. The array ****MUST**** be evaluated from 0-index forward, and the first expressions to return a value will be used for the rest of the entry's evaluation. The ability to declare multiple expressions this way allows the Verifier to account for format differences - for example: normalizing the differences in structure between JSON-LD/JWT-based [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) and vanilla [JSON Web Tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797) (JWTs).
          - The object ****MAY**** contain a `purpose` property, and if present its value ****MUST**** be a string that describes the purpose for which the field is being requested.
          - The object ****MAY**** contain a `filter` property, and if present its value ****MUST**** be [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/specification.html) descriptor used to filter against the values returned from evaluation of the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) string expressions in the `path` array.

### Input Evaluation

A consumer of a _Presentation Definition_ must filter inputs they hold (signed credentials, raw data, etc.) to determine whether they possess the inputs required to fulfill the demands of the Verifying party. A consumer of a _Presentation Definition_ ****SHOULD**** use the following process to validate whether or not its candidate inputs meet the requirements it describes:

For each _Input Descriptor_ in the `input_descriptors` array of a _Presentation Definition_, a User Agent ****should**** compare each candidate input it holds to determine whether there is a match. Evaluate each candidate input as follows:
  1. The schema of the candidate input ****must**** match one of the _Input Descriptor_ `schema` object `uri` values exactly. If the scheme is a hashlink or a similar value that points to immutable content, this means the content of the schema, not just the URI from which it is downloaded, must also match. If one of the values is an exact match, proceed, if there are no exact matches, skip to the next candidate input.
  2. If the `constraints` property of the _Input Descriptor_ is present, and it contains a `fields` property with one or more [_Input Descriptor Field Entries_](#input-descriptor-field-entry), evaluate each against the candidate input as follows:
      1. Iterate the _Input Descriptor_ `path` array of [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) string expressions from 0-index, executing each expression against the candidate input. Cease iteration at the first expression that returns a matching _Field Query Result_ and use the result for the rest of the field's evaluation. If no result is returned for any of the expressions, skip to the next candidate input.
      2. If the `filter` property of the field entry is present, validate the _Field Query Result_ from the step above against the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/specification.html) descriptor value.
      3. If the result is valid, proceed iterating the rest of the `fields` entries.
  3. If all of the previous validation steps are successful, mark the candidate input as a match for use in a _Presentation Submission_, and if present at the top level of the _Input Descriptor_, keep a relative reference to the `group` values the input is designated for.
  4. If the `constraints` property of the _Input Descriptor_ is present and it contains a `limit_disclosure` property set to the boolean value `true`, ensure that any subsequent submission of data in relation to the candidate input is limited to the entries specified in the `fields` property. If the `fields` property ****is not**** present, or contains zero [_Input Descriptor Field Entries_](#input-descriptor-field-entry), submission ****SHOULD NOT**** include any claim data from the credential. (for example: a Verifier may simply want to know a Subject has a valid, signed credential of a particular type, without disclosing any of the data it contains)

::: note
Any additional testing of a candidate input for a schema match beyond comparison of the schema `uri` (e.g. specific requirements or details expressed in schema `metadata`) is at the discretion of the implementer.
:::

## Presentation Submission

_Presentation Submissions_ are objects embedded within target credential negotiation formats that unify the presentation of proofs to a Verifier in accordance with the requirements a Verifier specified in a _Presentation Definition_. Embedded _Presentation Submission_ objects ****MUST**** be located within target data format as a `presentation_submission` property, which are composed as follows:

  - The object ****MUST**** include a `descriptor_map` property, and its value ****MUST**** be an array of _Input Descriptor Mapping Objects_, each being composed as follows:
      - The object ****MUST**** include an `id` property, and its value ****MUST**** be a string matching the `id` property of the _Input Descriptor_ in the _Presentation Definition_ the submission is related to.
      - The object ****MUST**** include a `path` property, and its value ****MUST**** be a [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) string expression that selects the credential to be submit in relation to the identified _Input Descriptor_ identified, when executed against the top-level of the object the _Presentation Submission_ is embedded within.

If for all credentials submitted in relation to [_Input Descriptor Objects_](#input-descriptor-objects) that include a `constraints` object with a `limit_disclosure` property set to the boolean value `true`, ensure that the data submitted is limited to the entries specified in the `fields` property of the `constraints` object. If the `fields` property ****is not**** present, or contains zero [_Input Descriptor Field Entries_](#input-descriptor-field-entry), the submission ****SHOULD NOT**** include any claim data from the credential. (for example: a Verifier may simply want to know a Subject has a valid, signed credential of a particular type, without disclosing any of the data it contains).

### Embed Targets

The following section details where the _Presentation Submission_ is to be embedded within a target data structure, as well as how to formulate the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) expressions to select the credentials within the target data structure.

## JSON Schema Vocabulary Definition

The _Presentation Exchange_ specification adopts and defines the following JSON Schema data format and processing variant, which implementers ****MUST**** support for evaluation of the portions of the _Presentation Exchange_ specification that call for JSON Schema validation: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-handrews-json-schema-02


## JSONPath Syntax Definition

The _Presentation Exchange_ specification adopts and defines the following syntax from the JSONPath object query language, which implementers ****MUST**** support for evaluation of the portions of the _Presentation Exchange_ specification that call for JSONPath expression execution.

JSONPath              | Description
----------------------|------------
` $`                  | The root object/element
` @`                  | The current object/element
`.`                   | Child member operator
`..`	                | Recursive descendant operator; JSONPath borrows this syntax from E4X
`*`	                  | Wildcard matching all objects/elements regardless their names
`[]`	                | Subscript operator
`[,]`	                | Union operator for alternate names or array indices as a set
`[start:end:step]` | Array slice operator borrowed from ES4 / Python
`?()`                 | Applies a filter (script) expression via static evaluation
`()`	                | Script expression via static evaluation 

**Example JSON Object**

```javascript
{
  "store": {
    "book": [ 
      {
        "category": "reference",
        "author": "Nigel Rees",
        "title": "Sayings of the Century",
        "price": 8.95
      }, {
        "category": "fiction",
        "author": "Evelyn Waugh",
        "title": "Sword of Honour",
        "price": 12.99
      }, {
        "category": "fiction",
        "author": "Herman Melville",
        "title": "Moby Dick",
        "isbn": "0-553-21311-3",
        "price": 8.99
      }, {
         "category": "fiction",
        "author": "J. R. R. Tolkien",
        "title": "The Lord of the Rings",
        "isbn": "0-395-19395-8",
        "price": 22.99
      }
    ],
    "bicycle": {
      "color": "red",
      "price": 19.95
    }
  }
}
```

**Example JSONPath Expressions**

JSONPath                      | Description
------------------------------|------------
`$.store.book[*].author`       | The authors of all books in the store
`$..author`                     | All authors
`$.store.*`                    | All things in store, which are some books and a red bicycle
`$.store..price`                | The price of everything in the store
`$..book[2]`                    | The third book
`$..book[(@.length-1)]`         | The last book via script subscript
`$..book[-1:]`                  | The last book via slice
`$..book[0,1]`                  | The first two books via subscript union
`$..book[:2]`                  | The first two books via subscript array slice
`$..book[?(@.isbn)]`            | Filter all books with isbn number
`$..book[?(@.price<10)]`        | Filter all books cheaper than 10
`$..book[?(@.price==8.95)]`        | Filter all books that cost 8.95
`$..book[?(@.price<30 && @.category=="fiction")]`        | Filter all fiction books cheaper than 30
`$..*`                         | All members of JSON structure


## Transport Integrations

### CHAPI

The [credential handler api (CHAPI)](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/) allows a web page to request data from a browser, and for a wallet to fulfill that request. This is commonly used for requesting and presenting verifiable credentials.

See also the [vp-request-spec](https://digitalbazaar.github.io/vp-request-spec/).

Here is an example of a request:

::: example Presentation Definition using CHAPI
```json
{
  "query": [
    {
      "type": "PresentationDefinitionQuery",
      "presentationDefinitionQuery": [
        // Presentation Definition goes here.
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
