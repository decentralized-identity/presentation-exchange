## Abstract

A common activity between peers in identity systems that feature the ability to
generate self-asserted and third-party issued [[ref:Claims]] is the demand and
submission of proofs from a [[ref:Holder]] to a [[ref:Verifier]]. This flow
implicitly requires the [[ref:Holder]] and [[ref:Verifier]] have a mechanism to
facilitate the two primary steps in a proving exchange: a way for
[[ref:Verifiers]] to describe proof requirements, and for [[ref:Holders]] to
describe submissions of proof which align with those requirements.

To address these needs, this Presentation Exchange specification codifies a
[[ref:Presentation Definition]] data format [[ref:Verifiers]] can use to
articulate proof requirements, and a [[ref:Presentation Submission]] data format
[[ref:Holders]] can use to describe proofs submitted in accordance with them.

This specification is designed to be both [[ref:Claim]] format and transport
envelope agnostic, meaning an implementer can use
[JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519),
[Verifiable Credentials (VCs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/),
[JWT-VCs](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token-extensions),
or any other JSON [[ref:Claim]] format, and convey them via
[Open ID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/),
[DIDComm](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/),
[Credential Handler API](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/),
or any other transport envelope. The goal of this flexible format- and
transport-agnostic mechanism is to enable unified procedures and code, thereby
reducing potentially redundant code and processing requirements.

This specification does not define transport protocols, specific endpoints, or
other means for conveying the formatted objects it codifies, but encourages
other specifications and projects that do define such mechanisms to utilize
these data formats within their flows.

## Status of This Document

Presentation Exchange v2.0.0 is a _PRE-DRAFT_ specification under development within
the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). It incorporates requirements and
learnings from related work of many active industry players into a shared
specification that meets the collective needs of the community.

This specification is regularly updated to reflect relevant changes, and we
encourage active engagement on
[GitHub](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange/issues)
and other mediums (e.g., [DIF Slack](https://difdn.slack.com/archives/C4X50SNUX)).

## Terminology

[[def:Claim, Claims]]
~ An assertion made about a [[ref:Subject]]. Used as an umbrella term for
Credential, Assertion, Attestation, etc.

[[def:Decentralized Identifiers, Decentralized Identifier, DID]]
~ Unique ID URI string and PKI metadata document format for describing the
cryptographic keys and other fundamental PKI values linked to a unique,
user-controlled, self-sovereign identifier in a target system (i.e. blockchain,
distributed ledger).

[[def:Embed Locations]]
~ Embed Locations are the specific paths and indexes per [[ref:Embed Target]]
where the [[ref:Verifier]] can expect to find the [[ref:Presentation
Submission]]. See [Embed Locations](#embed-locations).

[[def:Embed Target, Embed Targets]]
~ Embed Targets are data formats used in messaging protocols that may be used
to transport a [[ref:Presentation Submission]]. See
[Embed Targets](#embed-targets).

[[def:Feature, Features]]
~ Features enable [[ref:Verifiers]] to express, and processing entities to 
support, extended functionality (relative to the base objects) by defining
one or more properties on one or more objects. 

[[def:Holder, Holders]]
~ Holders are entities that submit proofs to [[ref:Verifiers]] to satisfy the
requirements described in a [[def:Presentation Definition]].

[[def:Holder Binding]]
~ Holder Bindings are requirements of a certain type of relationship between
the [[ref:Holder]] and the [[ref:Claims]] within the [[ref:Presentation
Submission]]. See [Holder Binding](#holder-and-subject-binding).

[[def:Identity Hub]]
~ Some examples refer to an unfamiliar query protocol, `hub://`, as a way of
storing and querying schemata and other resources. While orthogonal to this
specification and not yet on a standards track, the concept of "identity hubs"
proposes an architecture that may be of interest or utility to implementers of
 this specification. For more information, see the pre-draft specification
hosted at the decentralized identity foundation
[here](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identity-hub/blob/master/explainer.md)

[[def:Input Descriptor, Input Descriptors]]
~ Input Descriptors are used by a Verifier to describe the information required
of a [[ref:Holder]] before an interaction can proceed. See
[Input Descriptor](#input-descriptor).

[[def:Input Descriptor Object, Input Descriptor Objects]]
~ Input Descriptors Objects are populated with properties describing what type
of input data/[[ref:Claim]], or sub-fields thereof, are required for submission
to the [[ref:Verifier]]. See
[Input Descriptor Object](#input-descriptor-object).

[[def:Link Secrets]]
~ Link Secrets are values held by the [[ref:Holder]] but hidden from other
parties. They are typically incorporated into cryptographic signatures used in
claims to demonstrate correlation while preventing replay attacks. An Issuer
may ascertain that a Holder possesses a link secret without its disclosure.
See [Link Secrets](#link-secrets).

[[def:Presentation Definition]]
~ Presentation Definitions are objects that articulate what proofs a Verifier
requires. These help the Verifier to decide how or whether to interact with a
[[ref:Holder]]. Presentation Definitions are composed of inputs, which describe
the forms and details of the proofs they require, and optional sets of
selection rules, to allow Holders flexibility in cases where many different
types of proofs may satisfy an input requirement. See
[Presentation Definition](#presentation-definition).

[[def:Presentation Request]]
~ Presentation Requests are transport mechanisms for [[ref:Presentation
Definitions]].  Presentation Requests can take multiple shapes, using a variety
of protocols and signature schemes not refined in this specification. They are
sent by a [[ref:Verifier]] to a [[ref:Holder]]. Defining Presentation Requests
is outside the scope of this specification. See
[Presentation Request](#presentation-request).

[[def:Presentation Submission]]
~ Presentation Submissions are objects embedded within target claim negotiation
formats that unify the presentation of proofs to a [[ref:Verifier]] in
accordance with the requirements a [[ref:Verifier]] specified in a
[[ref:Presentation Definition]]. See
[Presentation Submission](#presentation-submission).

[[def:Subject, Subjects]]
~ Subjects are the entities about which [[ref:Claims]] are made. The Subject may
not be the same entity as the [[ref:Holder]]

[[def:Submission Requirement, Submission Requirements]]
~ Submission Requirements are objects that define what combinations of inputs
must be submitted to comply with the requirements a [[ref:Verifier]] has for
proceeding in a flow (e.g. credential issuance, allowing entry, accepting an
application). See [Submission Requirements](#submission-requirements).

[[def:Submission Requirement Object, Submission Requirement Objects]]
~ Submission Requirement Objects describe valid combinations of inputs in a
[[ref:Presentation Submission]]. See
[Submission Requirement Objects](#submission-requirement-objects).

[[def:Submission Requirement Rule, Submission Requirement Rules]]
~ Submission Requirement Rules describe combinatorical rules within a
[[ref:Submission Requirement Object]] when processing inputs. They may be
nested. See [Submission Requirement Rules](#submission-requirement-rules).

[[def:Verifier, Verifiers]]
~ Verifiers are entities that define what proofs they require from a
[[ref:Holder]] (via a [[ref:Presentation Definition]]) in order to proceed with
an interaction.

## Structure of this Document
This document has two primary sections: In the first, there is a model for defining the set of information a relying party would like to have presented, and in the second, there is a model for showing that the submitted presentation meets the related definition. 
Each of these sections begins by defining a base set of properties considered essential for core uses of the model, then describes additional feature sets that expand upon the base to allow more complex uses.
Objects are defined such that they may be used on their own or extended through 
[[ref:Features]] defined subsequently in the spec. A [[ref:Feature]] must 
declare if it has dependencies on other [[ref:Features]].

A [[ref:Feature]] enables [[ref:Verifiers]] to express, and processing entities
to support, extended functionality (relative to the base objects) by defining
one or more properties on one or more objects. 

Processing entities are not required to support [[ref:Features]].

## Presentation Definition

[[ref:Presentation Definitions]] are objects that articulate what proofs a
[[ref:Verifier]] requires. These help the [[ref:Verifier]] to decide how or
whether to interact with a [[ref:Holder]]. [[ref:Presentation Definitions]] are
composed of inputs, which describe the forms and details of the proofs they
require, and optional sets of selection rules, to allow [[ref:Holders]]
flexibility in cases where different types of proofs may satisfy an input
requirement.

The following properties are for use at the top-level of a
[[ref:Presentation Definition]]. Any properties that are not defined below MUST
be ignored, unless otherwise specified by a [[ref:Feature]];

- `id` - The [[ref:Presentation Definition]] ****MUST**** contain an `id`
  property. The value of this property ****MUST**** be a string. The string
  ****SHOULD**** provide a unique ID for the desired context. For example, a
  [UUID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) such as `32f54163-7166-48f1-93d8-f
  f217bdb0653` could provide an ID that is unique in a global context, while a
  simple string such as `my_presentation_definition_1` could be suitably unique
  in a local context.
- `input_descriptors` - The [[ref:Presentation Definition]]  ****MUST****
  contain an `input_descriptors` property. Its value ****MUST**** be an array of
  [[ref:Input Descriptor Objects]], the composition of which are described in
  the [`Input Descriptors`](#input-descriptors) section below.

  All inputs listed in the `input_descriptors` array are required for submission,
  unless otherwise specified by a [[ref:Feature]].

- `name` - The [[ref:Presentation Definition]] ****MAY**** contain a `name`
  property. If present, its value ****SHOULD**** be a human-friendly string
  intended to constitute a distinctive designation of the
  [[ref:Presentation Definition]].
- `purpose` - The [[ref:Presentation Definition]] ****MAY**** contain a
  `purpose` property. If present, its value ****MUST**** be a string that
  describes the purpose for which the [[ref:Presentation Definition]]'s inputs
  are being requested.
- The [[ref:Presentation Definition]] ****MAY**** include a `format` property.
  Some envelope transport protocols may include the value of this property in
  other locations and use different property names (See the [Format Embed Locations](#)
  section for details), but regardless of whether it resides at the default
  location (the `format` property of the `presentation_definition` object), the
  value ****MUST**** be an object with one or more properties matching the registered
  [Claim Format Designations](#claim-format-designations) (e.g., `jwt`, `jwt_vc`,
  `jwt_vp`, etc.). The properties inform the [[ref:Holder]] of the [[ref:Claim]]
  format configurations the [[ref:Verifier]] can process. The value for each
  claim format property ****MUST**** be an object composed as
  follows:
    - The object ****MUST**** include a format-specific property (i.e., `alg`,
      `proof_type`) that expresses which algorithms the [[ref:Verifier]]
      supports for the format. Its value ****MUST**** be an array of one or more
      format-specific algorithmic identifier references, as noted in the
      [Claim Format Designations](#claim-format-designations) section.

      For example:

```json
[[insert: ./test/presentation-definition/format_example.json]]
```

### Input Descriptor

[[ref:Input Descriptors]] are objects used to describe the information a
[[ref:Verifier]] requires of a [[ref:Holder]]. All [[ref:Input Descriptors]]
****MUST**** be satisfied, unless otherwise specified by a [[ref:Feature]].

[[ref: Input Descriptor Objects]] contain an identifier and may contain
 constraints on data values, and an explanation why a certain item or set of
data is being requested.

#### Input Descriptor Object

The following properties are for use at the top-level of a
[[ref: Input Descriptor Objects]]. Any properties that are not defined below MUST
be ignored, unless otherwise specified by a [[ref:Feature]];

- The [[ref:Input Descriptor Object]] ****MUST**** contain an `id` property.
  The value of the `id` property ****MUST**** be a string that does not
  conflict with the `id` of another [[ref:Input Descriptor Object]] in the same
  [[ref:Presentation Definition]].
- The [[ref:Input Descriptor Object]] ****MAY**** contain a `name` property. If
  present, its value ****SHOULD**** be a human-friendly name that describes what
  the target schema represents.
- The [[ref:Input Descriptor Object]] ****MAY**** contain a `purpose` property.
  If present, its value ****MUST**** be a string that describes the purpose for
  which the [[ref:Claim]]'s data is being requested.
- The [[ref:Input Descriptor Object]] ****MAY**** contain a `format` property.
  If present, its value ****MUST**** be an object with one or more properties
  matching the registered [Claim Format Designations](#claim-format-designations)
  (e.g., `jwt`, `jwt_vc`, `jwt_vp`, etc.). This `format` property is identical in
  value signature to the top-level `format` object, but can be used to specifically
  constrain submission of a single input to a subset of formats or algorithms.
- The [[ref:Input Descriptor Object]] ****MAY**** contain a `constraints`
  property. If present, its value ****MUST**** be an object composed as
  follows, unless otherwise specified by a [[ref:Feature]]:
    - The _constraints object_ ****MAY**** contain a `fields` property. Fields 
    ****SHALL**** be processed forward from 0-index, so if a [[ref:Verifier]] 
    desires to reduce processing by checking the most defining characteristics
    of a credential (e.g the type or schema of a credential) implementers 
    ****SHOULD**** order these field checks before all others to ensure
    earliest termination of evaluation. If the `fields` property is present,
    its value ****MUST**** be an array of objects composed as follows, unless
    otherwise specified by a faeture:
        - The _fields object_ ****MUST**** contain a `path` property. The value
          of this property ****MUST**** be an array of one or more
          [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) string
          expressions (as defined in the
          [JSONPath Syntax Definition](#jsonpath-syntax-definition) section)
          that select a target value from the input. The array ****MUST****
          be evaluated from 0-index forward, breaking as soon as a _Field
          Query Result_ is found (as described in
          [Input Evaluation](#input-evaluation)), which will be used for the
          rest of the entry's evaluation. The ability to declare multiple
          expressions in this way allows the [[ref:Verifier]] to account for
          format differences - for example: normalizing the differences in
          structure between JSON-LD/JWT-based
          [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) and
          vanilla JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [[spec:rfc7519]].
        - The _fields object_ ****MAY**** contain an `id` property. If present,
          its value ****MUST**** be a string that is unique from every other
          field object's `id` property, including those contained in other
          [[ref:Input Descriptor Objects]].
        - The _fields object_ ****MAY**** contain a `purpose` property. If
          present, its value ****MUST**** be a string that describes the purpose
          for which the field is being requested.
        - The _fields object_ ****MAY**** contain a `filter` property, and if
          present its value ****MUST**** be a
          [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/specification.html) descriptor
          used to filter against the values returned from evaluation of the
          [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) string
          expressions in the `path` array.
    - The _constraints object_ ****MAY**** contain a `limit_disclosure`
      property. If present, its value ****MUST**** be one of the following strings:
        - `required` - This indicates that the processing entity ****MUST****
          limit submitted fields to those listed in the `fields` array (if
          present). Processing entities are not required to implement support
          for this value, but they ****MUST**** understand this value
          sufficiently to return nothing (or cease the interaction with the 
          [[ref:Verifier]]) if they do not implement it.
        - `preferred` - This indicates that the processing entity ****SHOULD****
          limit submitted fields to those listed in the `fields` array (if
          present).

      Omission of the `limit_disclosure` property indicates the processing
      entity ****MAY**** submit a response that contains more than the data
      described in the `fields` array.


### Presentation Request

A [[ref:Presentation Request]] is any transport mechanism used to send a
[[ref:Presentation Definition]] from a [[ref:Verifier]] to a [[ref:Holder]]. A
wide variety of transport mechanisms or [[ref:Claim]] exchange protocols may be
used to send [[ref:Presentation Definitions]]. This specification does not
define [[ref:Presentation Requests]] and is designed to be agnostic to them.
Please note, however, that different use cases, supported signature schemes,
protocols, and threat models may require a [[ref:Presentation Request]]to have
certain properties. Some of these are expressed below:
- Signature verification -  Strongly identifying the entity making a request via
  a [[ref:presentation definition]] is outside the scope of this specification,
  however a [[ref:Holder]] may wish to have assurances as to the provenance,
  identity, or status of a [[ref:Presentation Definition]]. In this case, a
  [[ref:Presentation Request]] that uses digital signatures may be required.
- Replay protection - Some presentation protocols may require that presentations
  be unique, i.e., it should be possible for a [[ref:Verifier]] to detect if a
  presentation has been used before. Other protocols may require that a
  presentation be bound to a particular communication exchange or session. In
  these cases, a [[ref:Presentation Request]] that provides a `domain`,
  `challenge`, or `nonce` value may be required.


## Presentation Submission

[[ref:Presentation Submissions]] are objects embedded within target
[[ref:Claim]] negotiation formats that express how the inputs presented as
proofs to a [[ref:Verifier]] are provided in accordance with the requirements
specified in a [[ref:Presentation Definition]]. Embedded
[[ref:Presentation Submission]] objects ****MUST**** be located within target
data format as the value of a `presentation_submission` property, which is
composed and embedded as follows:

- The `presentation_submission` object ****MUST**** be included at the
  top-level of an Embed Target, or in the specific location described in the
  [Embed Locations table](#embed-locations) in the [Embed Target](#embed-target)
  section below.
- The `presentation_submission` object ****MUST**** contain an `id` property.
  The value of this property ****MUST**** be a unique identifier, such as a
  [UUID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122).
- The `presentation_submission` object ****MUST**** contain a `definition_id`
  property. The value of this property ****MUST**** be the `id` value of a valid
  [[ref:Presentation Definition]].
- The `presentation_submission` object ****MUST**** include a `descriptor_map`
  property. The value of this property ****MUST**** be an array of
  _Input Descriptor Mapping Objects_, composed as follows:
    - The `descriptor_map` object ****MUST**** include an `id` property. The
      value of this property ****MUST**** be a string that matches the `id`
      property of the [[ref:Input Descriptor]] in the
      [[ref:Presentation Definition]] that this [[ref:Presentation Submission]]
      is related to.
    - The `descriptor_map` object ****MUST**** include a `format` property. The
      value of this property ****MUST**** be a string that matches one of the
      [Claim Format Designation](#claim-format-designations). This denotes the
      data format of the [[ref:Claim]].
    - The `descriptor_map` object ****MUST**** include a `path` property. The
      value of this property ****MUST**** be a
      [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) string expression. The
      `path` property indicates the [[ref:Claim]] submitted in relation to the
      identified [[ref:Input Descriptor]], when executed against the top-level
      of the object the [[ref:Presentation Submission]] is embedded within.
    - The object ****MAY**** include a `path_nested` object to indicate the
      presence of a multi-[[ref:Claim]] envelope format. This means the
      [[ref:Claim]] indicated is to be decoded separately from its parent
      enclosure.
      + The format of a `path_nested` object mirrors that of a `descriptor_map`
        property. The nesting may be any number of levels deep. The `id`
        property ****MUST**** be the same for each level of nesting.
      + The `path` property inside each `path_nested` property provides a
        _relative path_ within a given nested value.

::: example Basic Presentation Submission object
```json
{
  // NOTE: VP, OIDC, DIDComm, or CHAPI outer wrapper properties would be here.

  "presentation_submission": {
    "id": "a30e3b91-fb77-4d22-95fa-871689c322e2",
    "definition_id": "32f54163-7166-48f1-93d8-ff217bdb0653",
    "descriptor_map": [

        "path": "$.verifiableCredential[0]"
      },

        "format": "ldp_vc",
        "path": "$.verifiableCredential[2]"
      }
    ]
  }

}
```
:::

### Processing of `path_nested` Entries

****Example Nested Submission****

```json
[[insert: ./test/presentation-submission/nested_submission_example.json]]
```

When the `path_nested` property is present in a [[ref:Presentation Submission]]
object, process as follows:

1. For each _Nested Submission Traversal Object_ in the `path_nested` array:
   1. Execute the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)
      expression string on the
      [_Current Traversal Object_](#current-traversal-object){id="current-traversal-object"},
      or if none is designated, the top level of the Embed Target.
   1. Decode and parse the value returned from
      [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) execution in
      accordance with the [Claim Format Designation](#claim-format-designations)
      specified in the object's `format` property. If the value parses and
      validates in accordance with the
      [Claim Format Designation](#claim-format-designations) specified, let the
      resulting object be the
      [_Current Traversal Object_](#current-traversal-object)
   1. If present, process the next _Nested Submission Traversal Object_ in the
      current `path_nested` property.
2. If parsing of the _Nested Submission Traversal Objects_ in the `path_nested`
   property produced a valid value, process it as the submission against the
   [[ref:Input Descriptor]] indicated by the `id` property of the containing
   _Input Descriptor Mapping Object_.

### Limited Disclosure Submissions

For all [[ref:Claims]] submitted in relation to [[ref:Input Descriptor Objects]]
that include a `constraints` object with a `limit_disclosure` property set to
the string value `required`, ensure that the data submitted is limited to the
entries specified in the `fields` property of the `constraints` object. If the
`fields` property ****is not**** present, or contains zero _field objects_, the
submission ****SHOULD NOT**** include any data from the [[ref:Claim]]. For
example, a [[ref:Verifier]] may simply want to know whether a [[ref:Holder]] has
a valid, signed [[ref:Claim]] of a particular type, without disclosing any of
the data it contains.

### Validation of Claims

Once a [[ref:Claim]] has been ingested via a [[ref:Presentation Submission]],
any validation beyond the process of evaluation defined by the
[Input Evaluation](#input-evaluation) section is outside the scope of
Presentation Exchange. Verification of signatures and other cryptographic proofs
are a function of the given [[ref:Claim]] format, and should be evaluated in
accordance with the given [[ref:Claim]] format's standardized processing steps.
Additional verification of [[ref:Claim]] data or subsequent validation required
by a given [[ref:Verifier]] are left to the [[ref:Verifier]]'s systems, code and
business processes to define and execute.

During validation, each [[ref:Input Descriptor]] Object ****MUST**** only refer
to a single discrete container within a [[ref:Presentation Submission]], such
that all checks refer to properties within the same container and are protected
by the same digital signature, if the container format supports digital
signatures. Examples of discrete container formats include a single Verifiable
Credential within a Verifiable Presentation as defined in
[W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/), OpenID
Connect Tokens, and JSON Web Tokens. This is to ensure that related
requirements, for example, "given name" and "family name" within the same
_Input Descriptor Object_ also come from the same container.

### Embed Targets

The following section details where the _Presentation Submission_ is to be
embedded within a target data structure, as well as how to formulate the
[JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) expressions to select the
[[ref:Claims]] within the target data structure.

#### Embed Locations

The following are the locations at which the `presentation_submission` object
****MUST**** be embedded for known target formats. For any location besides
the top level of the embed target, the location is described in JSONPath syntax.

Target     | Location
---------- | --------
OpenID     | top-level
DIDComms   | `$.presentations~attach.data.json`
VP         | top-level
CHAPI      | `$.data`


## Features

### Submission Requirement Feature

The Submission Requirement Feature introduces extensions enabling
[[ref:Verifiers]] to express what combinations of inputs must be submitted to
comply with its requirements for proceeding in a flow (e.g. credential
issuance, allowing entry, accepting an application).

#### Presentation Definition Extensions

The Submission Requirement [[ref:Feature]] extends the [[ref:Presentation Definition]] 
object to add a `submission_requirements` property.

When using this [[ref:Feature]]:
- `submission_requirements` - The [[ref:Presentation Definition]] ****MAY****
  contain a `submission_requirements` property. If present, its value
  ****MUST**** be an object conforming to the [[ref:Submission Requirement]]
  format described in the [`Submission Requirement`](#submission-requirement)
  section below.

  The `submission_requirements` property defines which [[ref:Input Descriptors]] 
  are required for submission, overriding the default input evaluation behavior, 
  in which all [[ref:Input Descriptors]] are required.

The Submission Requirement [[ref:Feature]] extends the [[ref:Input Descriptor Object]] 
to add a `group` property.

When using this [[ref:Feature]]:

- The [[ref:Input Descriptor Object]] ****MAY**** contain a `group` property. If
  present, its value ****MUST**** match one of the grouping strings listed in
  the `from` values of a [[ref:Submission Requirement Rule]] object.

#### Submission Requirements

[[ref:Presentation Definitions]] ****MAY**** include
[[ref:Submission Requirements]] which define what combinations of inputs a
processing entity must submit to comply with the requirements of a
[[ref:Verifier]].

[[ref:Submission Requirements]] introduce a set of rule types and mapping
instructions a processing entity can ingest to present requirement optionality
to the user, and subsequently submit inputs in a way that maps back to the rules
the [[ref:Verifier]] has asserted.

The following section defines the format for [[ref:Submission Requirements]]
and the selection syntax [[ref:Verifiers]] can use to specify which combinations
of inputs are acceptable.

If present, all [[ref:Submission Requirements]] ****MUST**** be satisfied, and
all `input_descriptors` ****MUST**** be grouped. Any unused
[ref:Input Descriptors]] that remain after satisfying all
[[ref:Submission Requirements]] ****MUST**** be ignored.

::: example Submission Requirement
```json
[[insert: ./test/submission-requirements/example.json ]]
```
:::

##### Submission Requirement Objects

[[ref:Submission Requirement Objects]] are JSON objects constructed as follows:

- A [[ref:Submission Requirement Object]] ****MUST**** contain a `rule`
  property. The value of this property ****MUST**** be a string that matches one
  of the [[ref:Submission Requirement Rules]] values listed in the section
  below.
- A [[ref:Submission Requirement Object]] ****MUST**** contain either a
  `from` or `from_nested` property. If both properties are present, the
  implementation ***MUST*** produce an error. The values of the `from` and
  `from_nested` properties are defined as follows:
    - `from` - The value of the `from` property ****MUST**** be a `group` string
      matching one of the `group` strings specified for one or more
      [[ref:Input Descriptor Objects].
    - `from_nested` - The value of the `from_nested` property ****MUST**** be an
      array [[ref:Submission Requirement Objects]].
- The [[ref:Submission Requirement Object]]  ****MAY**** contain a `name`
  property. If present, its value ****MUST**** be a string. The string
  ****MAY**** be used by a consuming User Agent to display the general name of
  the requirement set to a user.
- The [[ref:Submission Requirement Objects]] ****MAY**** contain a `purpose`
  property. If present, its value ****MUST**** be a string that describes the
  purpose for which the submission is being requested.
- The [[ref:Submission Requirement Objects]] ****MAY**** contain additional
  properties as required by certain [[ref:Submission Requirement Rules]]. For
  example, `count`, `min`, and `max` may be present with a `pick` rule.

##### Submission Requirement Rules

[[ref:Submission Requirement Rules]] are used within
[[ref:Submission Requirement Objects]] to describe the specific combinatorial
rules that must be applied to submit a particular subset of reqested inputs. The
specified [[ref:Submission Requirement Rule]] determines the behavior of the
corresponding `from` or `from_nested` property, as described below. A conformant
implementation ****MUST**** support the following rules:

##### `all` rule

For an `all` rule [[ref:Submission Requirement Object]]:

- The value of the `rule` property ****MUST**** be the string "all".
- The following behavior is required for the `from` or `from_nested` property:
  - `from` - All [[ref:Input Descriptors]] matching the `group` string of the
    `from` value ****MUST**** be submitted to the [[ref:Verifier]].
  - `from_nested` - All [[ref:Submission Requirement Objects]] specified in the
    `from_nested` array must be satisfied by the inputs submitted to the
    [[ref:Verifier]].

::: example Submission Requirement, all, group
```json
[[insert: ./test/submission-requirements/all_example.json]]
```
:::

##### `pick` rule

For a `pick` rule [[ref:Submission Requirement Object]]:

- The value of the `rule` property ****MUST**** be the string "pick".
- The [[ref:Submission Requirement Object]] ****MAY**** contain a `count`
  property. If present, its value ****MUST**** be an integer greater than zero.
  This indicates the number of [[ref:input Descriptors]] or
  [[ref:Submission Requirement Objects]] to be submitted.
- The [[ref:Submission Requirement Object]] ****MAY**** contain a `min`
  property. If present, its value ****MUST**** be an integer greater than or
  equal to zero. This indicates the minimum number of [[ref:input Descriptors]]
  or [[ref:Submission Requirement Objects]] to be submitted.
- The [[ref:Submission Requirement Object]] ****MAY**** contain a `max`
  property. If present, its value ****MUST**** be an integer greater than zero
  and, if also present, greater than the value of the `min` property. This
  indicates the maximum number of [[ref:input Descriptors]] or
  [[ref:Submission Requirement Objects]] to be submitted.
- The following behavior is required for the `from` or `from_nested` property:
    - `from` - The specified number of [[ref:Input Descriptors]] matching the
      `group` string of the `from` value ****MUST**** be submitted to the
      [[ref:Verifier]].
    - `from_nested` - The specified number of
      [[ref:Submission Requirement Objects]] in the `from_nested` array must be
      satisfied by the inputs submitted to the [[ref:Verifier]].

If [[ref:Submission Requirement Object]] has a `from` property, this directs the
processing entity to submit inputs from the set of [[ref:Input Descriptors]]
with a matching `group` string. In the first example that follows, the
[[ref:Submission Requirement]] requests a single input from
[[ref:Input Descriptor]] group `"B"`. In the second example, the
[[ref:Submission Requirement]] requests from 2 to 4 inputs from
[[ref:Input Descriptor]] group `"B"`.

::: example Submission Requirement, pick, group
```json
[[insert: ./test/submission-requirements/pick_1_example.json]]
```
:::

::: example Submission Requirement, pick, min/max
```json
[[insert: ./test/submission-requirements/pick_2_example.json]]
```
:::

If the [[ref:Submission Requirement Object]] has a `from_nested` property, this
directs the processing entity to submit inputs such that the number of satisfied
[[ref:Submission Requirement Objects]] matches the number requested. In the
following example, the `from_nested` property contains an array of
[[ref:Submission Requirement Objects]] which requests either all members
from group `"A"` or two members from group `"B"`:

::: example Submission Requirement, pick, nested
```json
[[insert: ./test/submission-requirements/pick_3_example.json]]
```
:::

##### Property Values and Evaluation

The following property value and evaluation guidelines summarize many of the
processing-related rules above:
- The `rule` property value may be either `"all"` or `"pick"`, and a conformant
  implementation ****MUST**** produce an error if an unknown `rule` value is
  present.
- The [[ref:Submission Requirement Object]] ****MUST**** contain a `from`
   property or a `from_nested` property, not both. If present their values must
   be a string or an array, respectively. If any of these conditions are not
   met, a conformant implementation ****MUST**** produce an error.
- A conformant implementation could use the following algorithm To determine
  whether a [[ref:Submission Requirement]] is satisfied:
  - If the `rule` is `"all"`, then the [[ref:Submission Requirement]]
    ****MUST**** contain a `from` property or a `from_nested` property, and of
    whichever are present, all inputs from the `from` group string or the
    `from_nested` [[ref:Submission Requirements]] array ****MUST**** be
    submitted or satisfied, respectively.
  - If the `rule` is `"pick"`, then the [[ref:Submission Requirement]]
    ****MUST**** contain a `from` property or a `from_nested` property, and of
    whichever are present, they must be evaluated as follows:
    - if a `count` property is present, the number of inputs submitted, or
      nested [[ref:Submission Requirements]] satisfied, ****MUST**** be exactly
      equal to the value of `count` property.
    - if a `min` property is present, the number of inputs submitted, or
      nested [[ref:Submission Requirements]] satisfied, ****MUST**** be equal to
      or greater than the value of the `min` property.
    - if a `max` property is present, the number of inputs submitted, or
      nested [[ref:Submission Requirements]] satisfied, ****MUST**** be equal to
      or less than the value of the `max` property.


### Predicate Feature

The predicate [[ref:Feature]] introduces properties enabling [[ref:Verifier]]
to request that processing entities apply a predicate and return the result.

#### Applying a predicate

The predicate [[ref:Feature]] extends the [[ref:Input Descriptor Object]]
`constraints.fields` object to add a `predicate` property.

When using this [[ref:Feature]], the _fields object_ ****MAY**** contain a 
[`predicate` property](#predicate-property). If the `predicate` property is 
present, the `filter` property ****MUST**** also be present.

:::note The inclusion of the `predicate` property indicates that the
processing entity returns a boolean, rather than a value returned
from evaluation of the
[JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) string
expressions in the `path` array. The boolean returned is the result
of using the `filter` property's
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/specification.html)
descriptors against the evaluated value. Exclusion of the `predicate`
property indicates that the processing entity returns the value
returned from evaluation of the
[JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) string
expressions in the `path` array.
:::

The value of `predicate` ****MUST**** be one of the following strings:
- `required` - This indicates that the returned value ****MUST****
  be the boolean result of applying the value of the `filter`
  property to the result of evaluating the `path` property.
  :::note Using a value of `required` for the `predicate` property
  may severely limit the responses a [[ref:Holder]] may be able to
  make. Many signature schemes do not support deriving predicates,
  even those signature schemes which are otherwise ZKP-capable. A
  [[ref:Verifier]] should be sure they support such schemes, and
  have high confidence they are also supported by the
  [[ref:Holder]], before indicating predicate responses are
  required.:::
- `preferred` - This indicates that the returned value
  ****SHOULD**** be the boolean result of applying the value of the
  `filter` property to the result of evaluating the `path` property.

If the `predicate` property is not present, a processing entity
****MUST NOT**** return derived predicate values.

If the [`predicate` property](#predicate-filters) is present, the set of JSON Schema
descriptors which comprise the value of the `filter` property
****MUST**** be restricted according to the desired predicate
operation, as follows:
  - To express the following range proofs, use the JSON Schema
    [numeric range](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric.html#range)
    properties:
      - `greater-than` - Use the `exclusiveMinimum` descriptor. For
        example, to request a proof that an attribute is greater than
        10000, use the following as the value of the `filter` object:
        ```json
        {
          "type": "number",
          "exclusiveMinimum": 10000,
        }
        ```
      - `less-than` - Use the `exclusiveMaximum` descriptor. For
        example, to request a proof that an attribute is less than 85,
        use the following as the value of the `filter` object:
        ```json
        {
          "type": "number",
          "exclusiveMaximum": 85,
        }
        ```
      - `greater-than or equal-to` - Use the `minimum` descriptor. For
        example, to request a proof that an attribute is greater than or
        equal to 18, use the following as the value of the `filter`
        object:
        ```json
        {
          "type": "number",
          "minimum": 18,
        }
        ```
      - `less-than or equal-to` - Use the `maximum` descriptor. For
        example, to request a proof that an attribute is less than or
        equal to 65536, use the following as the value of the `filter`
        object:
        ```json
        {
          "type": "number",
          "maximum": 65536,
        }
        ```
  - to express the following equality proofs, use the JSON Schema
    `const` descriptor:
      - `equal-to` - Use the `const` descriptor. For example to
        request proof that an attribute has the value "Chad", use the
        following as the value of the `filter` object:
        ```json
        {
          "const": "Chad"
        }
        ```
      - `not equal-to` - Use the `const` descriptor with the `not`
        operator. For example, to request proof that an attribute does
        not have the value "Karen", use the following as the value of
        the `filter` object:
        ```json
        {
          "not": {
            "const": "Karen"
          }
        }
        ```
  - to express set-membership proofs, use the JSON Schema `enum`
    descriptor:
      - `in-set` - Use the `enum` descriptor. For example, to
        request proof that an attribute is contained in the set of
        rainbow colors, use the following as the value of the `filter`
        object:
        ```json
        {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": ["red", "yellow", "blue"]
        }
        ```
      - `not-in-set` - Use the `enum` descriptor with the `not`
        operator. For example, to request proof that an attribute is
        not contained in the set of primary colors, use the following
        as the value of the `filter` object:
        ```json
        {
          "not": {
            "enum": ["red", "yellow", "blue"]
          }
        }
        ```

At this time, additional predicate operations are not supported.


### Relational Constraint Feature

The Relational Constraint [[ref:Feature]] extends the [[ref:Input Descriptor Object]]
`constraints` object with additional properties.

When using this [[ref:Feature]]:
- The _constraints object_ ****MAY**** contain a `subject_is_issuer`
  property. If present, its value ****MUST**** be one of the following
  strings:
    - `required` - This indicates that the processing entity ****MUST****
      submit a response that has been _self-attested_, i.e., the
      [[ref:Claim]] used in the presentation was 'issued' by the
      [[Ref:Subject]] of the [[ref:Claim]].
    - `preferred` - This indicates that it is ****RECOMMENDED**** that the
      processing entity submit a response that has been _self-attested_,
      i.e., the [[ref:Claim]] used in the presentation was 'issued' by the
      [[Ref:Subject]] of the [[ref:Claim]].
  :::note
  The `subject_is_issuer` property could be used by a [[ref:Verifier]] to
  require that certain inputs be _self_attested_. For example, a college
  application [[ref:Presentation Definition]] might contain an
  [[ref:Input Descriptor]] for an essay submission. In this case, the
  [[ref:Verifier]] would be able to require that the essay be provided by
  the same [[Ref:Subject]] as any other [[ref:Claims]] in the presented
  application.
  :::
- The _constraints object_ ****MAY**** contain an `is_holder` property. If
  present, its value ****MUST**** be an array of objects composed as
  follows:
    - The _is-holder object_ ****MUST**** contain a `field_id` property. The
      value of this property ****MUST**** be an array of strings, with each
      string matching the string value from a _field object_'s `id`
      property. This identifies the attribute whose [[Ref:Subject]] is of
      concern to the [[ref:Verifier]].
    - The _is-holder object_ ****MUST**** contain a `directive` property.
      The value of this property ****MUST****  be one of the following
      strings:
        - `required` - This indicates that the processing entity
          ****MUST**** include proof that the [[Ref:Subject]] of each
          attribute identified by a value in the `field_id` array is the
          same as the entity submitting the response.
        - `preferred` - This indicates that it is ****RECOMMENDED**** that
          the processing entity include proof that the [[Ref:Subject]] of
          each attribute identified by a value in the `field_id` array is
          the same as the entity submitting the response.

  The `is_holder` property would be used by a [[ref:Verifier]] to require
  that certain inputs be provided by a certain [[Ref:Subject]]. For example,
  an identity verification [[ref:Presentation Definition]] might contain an
  [[ref:Input Descriptor]] for a birthdate from a birth certificate. Using
  `is_holder`, the [[ref:Verifier]] would be able to require that the
  [[ref:Holder]] of the birth certificate [[ref:Claim]] is the same as the
  [[Ref:Subject]] of the birthdate attribute. This is especially useful in
  cases where a [[ref:Claim]] may have multiple [[Ref:Subjects]].

  For more information about techniques used to prove binding to a
  [[ref:Holder]], please see [_Holder Binding_](#holder-binding).
- The _constraints object_ ****MAY**** contain a `same_subject` property. If
  present, its value ****MUST**** be an array of objects composed as
  follows:
    - The _same-subject object_ ****MUST**** contain a `field_id` property.
      The value of this property ****MUST**** be an array of strings, with
      each string matching the string value from a _field object_'s `id`
      property. This identifies the attributes whose [[Ref:Subject]] is of
      concern to the [[ref:Verifier]]. It is important to note that the
      attributes whose [[Ref:Subject]] is of concern to the [[ref:Verifier]]
      ****MAY**** be identified in the _field object_ of a different
      [[ref:Input Descriptor Object]].
    - The _same-subject object_ ****MUST**** contain a `directive` property.
      The value of this property ****MUST****  be one of the following
      strings:
        - `required` - This indicates that the processing entity
          ****MUST**** include proof that the [[Ref:Subject]] of each
          attribute identified by a value in the `field_id` array is the
          same as the [[Ref:Subject]] of the attributes identified by the
          other values in the `field_id` array.
        - `preferred` - This indicates that it is ****RECOMMENDED**** that
          the processing entity include proof that the [[Ref:Subject]] of
          each attribute identified by a value in the `field_id` array is
          the same as the [[Ref:Subject]] of the attributes identified by
          the other values in the `field_id` array.


  The `same_subject` property would be used by a [[ref:Verifier]] to require
  that certain provided inputs be about the same [[Ref:Subject]]. For
  example, a [[ref:Presentation Definition]] might contain an
  [[ref:Input Descriptor]] which calls for a street address from a driver
  license [[ref:Claim]] and another [[ref:Input Descriptor]] which calls
  for a name from a birth certificate [[ref:Claim]]. Using the
  `same_subject` property, [[ref:Verifier]] would be able to require that
  the [[Ref:Subject]] of the street address attribute [[ref:Claim]] is the
  same as the [[Ref:Subject]] of the name attribute.


### Credential Status Constraint Feature

- The _constraints object_ ****MAY**** contain a `statuses` property. If
present, its value ****MUST**** be an object that includes one or more of
the following status properties:
   - `active` - A credential is active if it is not revoked, expired,
     suspended, or in any type of deactivated state.
   - `suspended` - A credential is suspended if the Issuer has published an
     explicit signal that the credential is in an inactive state and
     ****should not**** currently be relied upon, but may become active
     again in the future.
   - `revoked` - A credential is revoked if the Issuer has published an
     explicit signal that the credential in question ****should not**** be
     relied upon going forward as an accurate reflection of the Issuer's
     statements about the [[Ref:Subject]] within the scope of the
     credential.

The values of all status properties are objects, composed as follows:
  - _status objects_ ****MUST**** include a `directive` property, and its
    value ****MUST**** be one of the following strings:
      - `required` - the credential ****MUST**** be of the specified
        status.
      - `allowed` - the credential ****MAY**** be of the specified status.
      - `disallowed` - the credential ****MUST NOT**** be of the specified
        status.
    ```json
      "statuses": {
        "active": {
          "directive": "required"  // other values: "allowed", "disallowed"
        },
        "suspended": {...},
        "revoked": {...}
      }
    ```
  ::: note
  There is no assumed direct mapping between these values and a
  corresponding status object in the underlying credentials. On the
  contrary, the encoding and decoding of a credential status (which may
  include fetching remote status information or cryptographic operations) is
  an implementation detail which takes place at a lower layer of abstraction
  and in accordance with the supported verifiable credential formats and
  presentation protocols.
  :::


### JSON-LD Framing Feature

The JSON-LD Framing [[ref:Feature]] extends [ref:Presentation Definition]] to support
extended with the JSON-LD document framing.

When using this [[ref:Feature]]:

- `frame` - The [[ref:Presentation Definition]] ****MAY**** contain a `frame` ***
  property. If present, its value ****MUST**** be a 
  [JSON LD Framing Document](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-framing/) object.

## Input Evaluation

A processing entity of a [[ref:Presentation Definition]] must filter inputs they
hold (signed [[ref:Claims]], raw data, etc.) to determine whether they possess
the inputs requested by the [[ref:Verifier]]. A processing entity of a
[[ref:Presentation Definition]] ****SHOULD**** use the following process to
validate whether or not its candidate inputs meet the requirements it describes:

For each [[ref:Input Descriptor]] in the `input_descriptors` array of a
[[ref:Presentation Definition]], a processing entity ****SHOULD**** compare each
candidate input (JWT, Verifiable Credential, etc.) it holds to determine whether
there is a match.

For each candidate input:
  1. If the `constraints` property of the [[ref:Input Descriptor]] is present,
     and it contains a `fields` property with one or more _fields objects_,
     evaluate each _fields object_ against the candidate input as described
     in the following subsequence.

     Accept the candidate input if every _fields object_ yields a _Field Query
     Result_; else, reject.
     1. For each [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) expression
        in the `path` array (incrementing from the 0-index), evaluate the
        JSONPath expression against the candidate input and repeat the
        following subsequence on the result.

        Repeat until a _Field Query Result_ is found, or the `path` array
        elements are exhausted:
        1. If the result returned no JSONPath match, skip to the next
          `path` array element
        2. Else, evaluate the first JSONPath match (_candidate_) as follows:
           1. If the _fields object_ has no `filter`, or if _candidate_
              validates against the
              [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/specification.html)
              descriptor specified in `filter`, then:
              ::: note  
              **Predicate Feature Only**

              If the _fields object_ has a `predicate`, set _Field Query Result_ to
              the boolean value resulting from evaluating the _Field Query Result_ against
              the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/specification.html) descriptor value
              of the `filter` property.
                            
              Else
              :::
              - set _Field Query Result_ to be _candidate_

           2. Else, skip to the next `path` array element
  2. If all of the previous validation steps are successful, mark the candidate
     input as a match for use in a [[ref:Presentation Submission]].
      ::: note 
      **Submission Requirement Feature Only**
     
      If present at the top level of the [[ref:Input Descriptor]], keep a
      relative reference to the `group` values the input is designated for.
      :::

 3. If the `constraints` property of the [[ref:Input Descriptor]] is present,
     and it contains a `limit_disclosure` property set to the string value
     `required`, ensure that any subsequent submission of data in relation to the
     candidate input is limited to the entries specified in the `fields`
     property. If the `fields` property ****is not**** present, or contains zero
     _field objects_, submission ****SHOULD NOT**** include any [[ref:Claim]]
     data from the [[ref:Claim]]. For example, a [[ref:Verifier]] may simply
     want to know a [[ref:Holder]] has a valid, signed [[ref:Claims]] of a
     particular type, without disclosing any of the data it contains.

 **Relational Constraint Feature Only**

  4. If the `constraints` property of the [[ref:Input Descriptor]] is present,
     and it contains a `subject_is_issuer` property set to the value `required`,
     ensure that any submission of data in relation to the candidate input is
     fulfilled using a _self_attested_ [[ref:Claim]].
  5. If the `constraints` property of the [[ref:Input Descriptor]] is present,
     and it contains an `is_holder` property, ensure that for each object in the
     array, any submission of data in relation to the candidate input is
     fulfilled by the [[Ref:Subject]] of the attributes so identified by the
     strings in the `field_id` array.
  6. If the `constraints` property of the [[ref:Input Descriptor]] is present,
     and it contains a `same_subject` property, ensure that for each object in
     the array, all of the attributes so identified by the strings in the
     `field_id` array are about the same [[Ref:Subject]].

### Expired and Revoked Data

Certain types of [[ref:Claims]] have concepts of _expiration_ and _revocation_.
_Expiration_ is mechanism used to communicate a time after which a [[ref:Claim]]
will no longer be valid. _Revocation_ is a mechanism used by an issuer to
express the status of a [[ref:Claim]] after issuance. Different [[ref:Claim]]
specifications handle these concepts in different ways.

[[ref:Presentation Definitions]] have a need to specify whether expired,
revoked, or [[ref:Claims]] of other statuses can be accepted. For [[ref:Claims]]
that have simple status properties,
[Input Descriptor Filters](#input-descriptor-objects) JSON Schema can be used to
specify acceptable criteria.

The first example below demonstrates _expiry_ using the [VC Data Model's
 `expirationDate` property](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#expiration-0).
The second example below demonstrates _revocation_, or more generally,
_credential status_ using the
[VC Data Model's `credentialStatus` property](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#status-0).
Using the syntax provided in the example, a [[ref:Verifier]] will have all
requisite information to resolve the status of a [[ref:Claim]].

### Holder and Subject Binding
[[ref:Claims]] often rely on proofs of [[ref:Holder]] or [[ref:Subject]] binding
for their validity. A [[ref:Verifier]] may wish to determine that a particular
[[ref:Claim]], or set of [[ref:Claims]] is bound to a particular [[ref:Holder]]
or [[ref:Subject]]. This can help the [[ref:Verifier]] to determine the
legitimacy of the presented proofs.

Some mechanisms which enable proof of [[ref:Holder]] binding are described
below. These include proof of identifier control, proof the [[ref:Holder]] knows
a secret value, and biometrics. An [[ref:Issuer]] can make proofs of
[[ref:Holder]] binding possible by including [[ref:Holder]] information either
in the [[ref:Claim]] or the [[ref:Claim]] signature.

Some examples of [[ref:Subject]] binding include matching the [[ref:Subject]] of
one [[ref:Claim]] with that of another, or matching the [[ref:Subject]] of a
[[ref:Claim]] with the [[ref:Holder]].

#### Proof of Identifier Control
A number of [[ref:Claim]] types include an identifier for the [[ref:Claim]]
[[Ref:Subject]]. A [[ref:Verifier]] may wish to ascertain that one of the
[[Ref:Subject]] identified in the [[ref:Claim]] is the one submitting the proof,
or has consented to the proof submission. A [[ref:Claim]] may also include an
identifier for the [[ref:Holder]], independent of the [[Ref:Subject]]
identifiers.

One mechanism for providing such proofs is the use of a [[ref:DID]] as the
identifier for the [[ref:Claim]] [[Ref:Subject]] or [[ref:Holder]]. DIDs enable
an entity to provide a cryptographic proof of control of the identifier, usually
through a demonstration that the [[ref:DID]] Controller knows some secret value,
such as a private key.

The [[ref:Holder]] or [[ref:Subject]] can demonstrate this proof of control when
the [[ref:Claim]] is presented. In addition to verifying the authenticity and
origin of the [[ref:Claim]] itself, a [[ref:Verifier]] can verify that the
[[ref:Holder]] or [[ref:Subject]] of the [[ref:Claim]] still controls the
identifier.

#### Link Secrets
Some [[ref:Claim]] signatures support the inclusion of [[ref:Holder]]-provided
secrets that become incorporated into the signature, but remain hidden from the
[[ref:Claim]] issuer. One common use of this capability is to bind the
[[ref:Claim]] to the [[ref:Holder]]. This is sometimes called a _link secret_.

Just as with proof of control of an identifier, link secret proofs demonstrate
that the [[ref:Holder]] knows some secret value. Upon presentation to a
[[ref:Verifier]], the [[ref:Holder]] demonstrates knowledge of the secret
without revealing it. The [[ref:Verifier]] can verify that the [[ref:Holder]]
knows the link secret, and that the link secret is contained in the
[[ref:Claim]] signature. The [[ref:Holder]] can provide this proof for each
presented [[ref:Claim]], thereby linking them together.

#### Biometrics
This type of [[ref:Holder]] binding, instead of relying on demonstrating
knowledge of some secret value, relies on the evaluation of biometric data.
There are a number of mechanisms for safely embedding biometric information in a
[[ref:Claim]] such that only a person who can confirm the biometric may present
the [[ref:Claim]].


## Claim Format Designations

Within the _Presentation Exchange_ specification, there are numerous sections
where [[ref:Verifiers]] and [[ref:Holders]] convey what [[ref:Claim]] variants
they support and are submitting. The following are the normalized references
used within the specification:

- `jwt` - the format is a JSON Web Token (JWTs) [[spec:rfc7519]]
  that will be submitted in the form of a JWT encoded string. Expression of
  supported algorithms in relation to this format ****MUST**** be conveyed using
  an `alg` property paired with values that are identifiers from the JSON Web
  Algorithms registry [[spec:RFC7518]].
- `jwt_vc`, `jwt_vp` - these formats are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [[spec:rfc7519]]
  that will be submitted in the form of a JWT encoded string, and the body of
  the decoded JWT string is defined in the JSON Web Token (JWT) [[spec:rfc7519]]
  section of the
  [W3C Verifiable Credentials specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token).
  Expression of supported algorithms in relation to these formats ****MUST****
  be conveyed using an `alg` property paired with values that are identifiers
  from the JSON Web Algorithms registry [[spec:RFC7518]].
- `ldp` - the format is a Linked Data Proof [[spec:Linked Data Proofs]] that will 
  be submitted as an object.
  Expression of supported algorithms in relation to these formats ****MUST****
  be conveyed using a `proof_type` property with values that are identifiers
  from the
  [Linked Data Cryptographic Suite Registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-cryptosuite-registry/).
- `ldp_vc`, `ldp_vp` - Verifiable Credential Linked Data Proof and Verifiable Presentation Linked
  Data Proof formats. These are descriptions of formats normatively defined in the W3C Verifiable
  Credentials specification [[spec:VC-DATA MODEL]], and will be submitted in the form of a JSON
  object. 
  Expression of supported algorithms in relation to these formats ****MUST****
  be conveyed using a `proof_type` property paired with values that are
  identifiers from the
  [Linked Data Cryptographic Suite Registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-cryptosuite-registry/).

## JSON Schemas

### Vocabulary Definition

The _Presentation Exchange_ specification adopts and defines the following JSON
Schema data format and processing variant, which implementers ****MUST****
support for evaluation of the portions of the _Presentation Exchange_
specification that call for JSON Schema validation:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-handrews-json-schema-02

### Presentation Definition

```json
[[insert: ./test/presentation-definition/schema.json]]
```

### Submission Requirements

```json
[[insert: ./test/submission-requirements/schema.json]]
```

### Format Declaration

```json
[[insert: ./test/presentation-definition/formats-schema.json]]
```

## JSONPath Syntax Definition

The _Presentation Exchange_ specification adopts and defines the following
syntax from the JSONPath object query language, which implementers ****MUST****
support for evaluation of the portions of the _Presentation Exchange_
specification that call for JSONPath expression execution.

JSONPath              | Description
----------------------|------------
` $`                  | The root object/element
` @`                  | The current object/element
`.`                   | Child member operator
`..`	                | Recursive descendant operator; JSONPath borrows this syntax from E4X
`*`	                  | Wildcard matching all objects/elements regardless their names
`[]`	                | Subscript operator
`[,]`	                | Union operator for alternate names or array indices as a set
`[start:end:step]`    | Array slice operator borrowed from ES4 / Python
`?()`                 | Applies a filter (script) expression via static evaluation
`()`	                | Script expression via static evaluation
